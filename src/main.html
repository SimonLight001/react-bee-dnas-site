      <p>Most people are familiar with honey bees and bumblebees, but look closely and there are smaller furry bees moving from flower to flower. There are around 20,000 described bee species worldwide. Most of these bees are known as solitary bees with only 250 bumblebee species, 9 honey bee species and a number of social stingless bees worldwide. In Britain we have around 270 species of bee, just under 250 of which are solitary bees. These bees can be amazingly effective pollinators and as the name suggests tend not to live in colonies like bumblebees and honey bees.</p>
      <p>Pollinators, including solitary bees, carry out a vital role in pollinating our crops, and also flowers and trees. In some parts of China pollination is already being undertaken by hand using paintbrushes because there are no bees left to do it naturally. We used to think that honey bees were the biggest contributors to crop pollination but that simply isn't the case today, in actual fact we now know that a single mason bee pollinates the equivilant of around 100 honey bees. </p>
      <p>Unlike honey bees, solitary bees live alone, and do not make honey. They actually get their food from drinking the nectar directly from flowers. As a result of this, when these bees venture out to particularly urban areas, they often use more energy than they can find, and often starve. This is why its more important than ever, when you see a bee on the ground, try feed it some of the sugar water fro your beevive and help them save the world.</p>
